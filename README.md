# The Book Social

[Live Site](https://thebooksocial.onrender.com)

TheBookSocial serves as a space for users to read novels together with the added capability to make commentary and reactions while reading directly in the text. Users will see indications that other users have left comments on the exact line they are reading and will be able to see and react to those comments. Reading novels will no longer just be a solo activity but can be a shared experience. Customize that experience by creating clubs to invite friends and see comments only by club members. Track user reactions to your comments to see how others liked your comments!
